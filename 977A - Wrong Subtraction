/*
Approach:
- Within the limit k, for every iteration, check for 2 conditions. They are:
  - If the number ends with a non-zero digit, then subtract the given number by 1
  - If not, then divide the number by 10
- Repeat this process until the condition of number of times, i.e k gets satisfied.

# CODE

def subtraction(n,k):
    j=0
    while j<k:
