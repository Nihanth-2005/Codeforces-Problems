/*
Approach:
# Bruteforce
- First, the unique characters in the given string are extracted by checking each character.
# Optimized
- Set operation can be used to extract the unique characters of the given string name.

- If the number of distinct characters in one's user name is odd, then he is a male
- If the number of distinct characters in one's username is even, then she is a female
